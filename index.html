            <p>Dear Vipassana Organization,</p>
            <p>We approach you with the utmost respect and gratitude for the invaluable teachings that Vipassana centers provide. This initiative is a heartfelt request from practitioners who deeply value the principles of <strong>metta</strong>. We humbly ask that you consider aligning your centers with these core values by embracing a fully vegan practice.</p>

            <h2>Why This Change Matters</h2>
            <p>Vipassana teaches us compassion, non-violence, and the wish for all beings to be free from suffering. The continued use of animal products within centers contradicts these teachings. Supporting such industries undermines the principles of <strong>sila</strong> and <strong>metta</strong>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p><strong>Vipassana</strong> means to 'see things as they are.' As practitioners, we are taught to observe reality with clarity and understanding. In this spirit, we kindly ask you to reflect on the realities of the animal industry, the implications of using animal products, and how phasing them out aligns with the values that Vipassana upholds.</p> 

            <p><strong>Veganism</strong> is the philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.</p>
                
            <p><strong>Metta</strong> refers to the practice of loving-kindness or goodwill, emphasizing the cultivation of unconditional compassion towards oneself and all living beings. By promoting the understanding that all beings wish to be happy and free from suffering, metta serves as a foundational practice that encourages a compassionate attitude and supports the journey toward inner peace and understanding in Vipassana.</p>
                
            <p>Transitioning to a plant-based diet is a logical step for Vipassana centers, as it aligns seamlessly with the principles of metta and non-harming that underpin our practice. By making this shift, we can create an environment that truly reflects our commitment to compassion, reduce our ecological footprint, and foster a community dedicated to the well-being of all sentient beings.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Reflection on Animal Products</h2>
            <p>The global animal industry involves omniscient widespread suffering, exploitation, and environmental harm. As Vipassana practitioners, we are asked to see things as they truly are.</p>
            <p><strong>What is the reality</strong> behind the animal products we consume?</p>
            <p><strong>Milk:</strong> In modern dairy farming, cows are repeatedly impregnated and separated from their calves, causing immense suffering to both mother and offspring. Calves are often taken to slaughter, and mothers are eventually slaughtered when their milk production declines.</p>
            <p><strong>Honey:</strong> The honey industry often involves practices that harm bees, such as artificial breeding, wing clipping of queens, and the destruction of colonies to extract honey. These practices disturb the natural processes of these essential creatures and cause harm. Studies show that honey bees, due to their large colonies, can deplete floral resources, impacting the reproductive success and foraging behavior of native bees. This competition has led to declining populations of some native bee species, which are vital to maintaining biodiversity. Furthermore, industrial beekeeping practices can contribute to the spread of diseases and pests, further threatening native pollinators. As stewards of the environment, it’s essential to reconsider our reliance on honey and shift towards practices that protect all pollinator species.

            <h2>Alignment with Vipassana Values</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Metta:</strong> Metta is the sincere wish for all beings to be happy and free from suffering. By removing animal products from the centers, Vipassana can extend its practice of metta to include all sentient beings, ensuring that no being is harmed in the preparation of food for practitioners or in any other aspect of center operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Ahimsa:</strong> Ahimsa is a fundamental precept in Vipassana teachings. To live in non-violence means to avoid harming any living being, in thought, word, or action. By supporting industries that harm animals, we are indirectly contributing to violence. A vegan practice would help Vipassana centers embody true non-violence in every aspect.</li>
                <li><strong>Sila:</strong> Sila asks us to refrain from killing and harming living beings. It is clear that, in today's world, animal agriculture and related industries violate this precept. By adopting a vegan practice, Vipassana centers can more closely follow the ethical guidelines taught by the Buddha.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Our Request</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase out animal products</strong> at all centers.</li>
                <li><strong>Use plant-based alternatives</strong> that align with the values of metta and ahimsa.</li>
                <li><strong>Educate</strong> practitioners on the ethical reasons behind this shift.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Common Concerns</h2>
            <p>We understand there may be concerns, and we are committed to addressing them with care and compassion. Below are some common concerns and suggestions for addressing them:</p>
            <p><strong>Medical needs:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Generally, studies and dietary organizations, including the British Dietetic Association<sup>1</sup> and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics<sup>2</sup> among many others<sup>3,4</sup>, have concluded that there are no nutritional risks in following a vegan diet to any stage of the human life cycle when due attention is given to B12 and vitamin and calcium intake, with a plant-based diet being labeled as ‘<em>appropriate for all stages of the life cycle</em>’<sup>5</sup>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Many Vipassana Centers already include fortified nutritional yeast on their menu. The recommended serving of one to two tablespoons of nutritional yeast contains 150% vitamin B12 and 720% riboflavin of the recommended dose. It also provides a sufficient amount of the other B vitamins. Other suitable B12-fortified foods include some breakfast cereals, soya yogurts, and plant-based dairy alternatives.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The only valid exception would be a medical requirement documented by a physician, that mandates the use of animal products such as milk. In these cases, the centers can source animal products from the extremely rare most compassionate, ethical sources or work with plant-based nutritional experts to provide appropriate alternatives. Medical exceptions can be handled with sensitivity, while still maintaining the overall goal of reducing harm.
                </p>
                
            <p><strong>Tradition:</strong></p>
                <p> We recognize that Vipassana centers have a long-standing tradition of vegetarianism. However, as our understanding of non-violence evolves, so too must our practices. A shift towards veganism is a natural extension of the values Vipassana teaches.</p>

            The German Nutrition Society (DGE) has reassessed its position on vegan nutrition in 2024. In addition to more current data on health, it is considering all four target dimensions of a more sustainable diet for the first time:

              <li>
                <strong>Cane and Tepedino (2016):</strong> This study found that a single honey bee apiary can deplete floral resources needed by native bees, with a standard 40-hive apiary consuming pollen equivalent to what 4 million wild bees would use in three months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Goulson et al. (2002), Thomson (2016):</strong> These studies documented negative impacts of honey bees on bumblebee populations, including reduced reproductive success, forced shifts in foraging behavior, and competition for floral resources, leading to declines in native bee populations.

              <li>
                <strong>Hudewenz & Klein (2015):</strong> Research shows that honey bees can displace native bees from flowers, which alters the natural foraging patterns of native bees and can negatively affect their reproduction.
